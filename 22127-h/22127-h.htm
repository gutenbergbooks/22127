<h3>THE "AGAPEMONE" OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

  <p>As it is not generally known that the "Agapemone" had a prototype in
  the celebrated <i>Family of Love</i>, some account of this "wicked sect"
  may not at this moment be without interest to your readers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Henry Nicholas, a Westphalian, born at Munster, but who had lived a
  great while at Amsterdam, and some time likewise at Embden, was the
  father of this family. He appeared upon the stage about the year 1540,
  styled himself the <i>deified man</i>, boasted of great matters, and
  seemed to exalt himself above the condition of a human creature. He was,
  as he pretended, greater than Moses and Christ, because Moses had taught
  mankind to <i>hope</i>, Christ to <i>believe</i>, but he to <i>love</i>;
  which last being of more worth than both the former, he was consequently
  greater than both those prophets."&mdash;See Brandt's <i>Hist. of the
  Reform, &amp;c., in the Low Countries</i>, vol. i. p. 105, ed. 1720.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>According to some writers, however, the sect was not founded by Henry
  Nicholas, but by David George, an Anabaptist enthusiast of Delft, who
  died in 1556; and indeed there is some reason to believe that the
  <i>Family of Love</i> grew out of the heresies of the said George, with
  whom Nicholas had been on friendly terms.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'Not content,' says Fuller, speaking of Nicholas, 'to confine his
  errors to his own country, over he comes into England, and in the latter
  end of the reign of Edward the Sixth, joyned himself to the Dutch
  congregation in London, where he seduced a number of artificers and silly
  women.'"&mdash;<i>Church. Hist.</i>, p. 112, ed. 1655.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On the 12th of June, 1575, according to the historian Hollinshed,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Stood at Paule's Crosse five persons, Englishmen, of the sect termed
  the Familie of Love, who there confessed themselves utterlie to detest as
  well the author of that sect, H. N., as all his damnable errors and
  heresies."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A curious little volume on the history and doctrines of this sect
  appeared in the year 1572, from the pen of John Rogers, entitled <i>The
  Displaying of an horrible Secte of grosse and wicked Heretiques, naming
  themselves the Family of Love, with the Lives of their Authors, and what
  Doctrine they teach in Corners. Imprinted at London for George
  Bishop.</i> 1579. 12mo. Christopher Vittall, a joiner of Southwark, who
  had been infected with the doctrine of Arius some twenty years before,
  and whose credit was great amongst the <i>Family of Love</i>, was at this
  period actively engaged in teaching their doctrines. He travelled about
  the country to disseminate them; and was likewise author of a little
  book, in reply to Roger's <i>Displaying</i> of the sect, printed in the
  same year.</p>

  <p>At the close of the year 1580 the sect was increasing so rapidly in
  England, that the government took active measures for its suppression,
  and the Queen issued a proclamation to search for the "teachers or
  professors of the foresaid damnable sect," and to "proceed severelie
  against them." <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span>This proclamation may be seen in Hollinshed
  and in Camden's <i>Annals</i>.<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>After the death of Queen Elizabeth&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Family of Love (or Lust rather)," according to Fuller, "presented
  a tedious petition to King James, so that it is questionable whether his
  Majesty ever graced it with his perusall, wherein they endeavoured to
  cleare themselves from some misrepresentations, and by fawning expression
  to insinuate themselves into his Majesty's good opinion."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After printing the petition Fuller proceeds&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I finde not what effect this their petition produced, whether it was
  slighted and the petitioners looked upon as inconsiderable, or beheld as
  a few frantick folk out of their wits, which consideration alone often
  melted their adversaries' anger into pity unto them. The main design
  driven on in the petition is, to separate themselves from the Puritans
  (as persons odious to King James), that they might not fare the worse for
  their vicinity unto them; though these Familists could not be so desirous
  to leave them as the others were glad to be left by them. For if their
  opinions were so senseless, and the lives of these Familists so sensuall
  as is reported, no <i>purity</i> at all belonged unto them."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <i>Family of Love</i>, after being exposed and ridiculed both in
  "prose and rime," finally "gave up the ghost," and was succeeded by
  another "wicked sect" denominated the <i>Ranters</i>.</p>

<h3>PUNISHMENT OF DEATH BY BURNING.</h3>

  <p>A woman was strangled and burnt for coining in front of the Debtors
  door, Newgate, on the 10th of March, 1789. I believe this to be the last
  instance in which this old punishment was inflicted, at least in the
  metropolis. The burning part of the ceremony was abolished by the 30 Geo.
  III., c. 48., and death by hanging made the penalty for women in cases of
  high or petty treason. E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W.'s informants are wrong in supposing
  that the criminals were burnt whilst living. The law, indeed, prescribed
  it, but the practice was more humane. They were first strangled; although
  it sometimes happened that, through the bungling of the executioner, a
  criminal was actually burnt alive, as occurred in the celebrated case of
  Katherine Hayes, executed for the murder of her husband in 1726. The
  circumstances of this case are so remarkable, that, having referred to
  it, I am induced to recapitulate the chief of them, in the belief that
  they will interest your readers. Hayes, who was possessed of some little
  property, lodged with his wife Katherine in Tyburn, now Oxford Road. Mrs.
  Hayes prevailed upon two men, named Billings (who lodged in the house)
  and Wood, a friend of Hayes, to assist her in murdering her husband. To
  facilitate that object, Hayes was induced to drink the enormous quantity
  of seven bottles (at that time full quarts) of Mountain wine, besides
  other intoxicating drinks. After finishing the seventh bottle he fell on
  the floor, but soon after arose and threw himself on a bed. There, whilst
  in a state of stupefaction, he was despatched by Billings and Wood
  striking him on the head with a hatchet. The murderers then held council
  as to the best mode of concealing their crime, and it was determined that
  they should mutilate and dispose of the body. They cut off the head, Mrs.
  Hayes holding a pail to catch the blood; and she proposed that the head
  should be boiled until the flesh came from the skull. This advice was
  rejected on account of the time which the process suggested would occupy,
  and Billings and Wood carried the head in the pail (it was at night) to
  the Horseferry at Westminster, and there cast it into the Thames. On the
  following day the murderers separated the limbs from the body, and
  wrapping them, together with the trunk, in two blankets, carried them to
  Marylebone fields, and placed them in a pond. Hayes' head not having been
  carried away by the tide, as the murderers expected it would have been,
  was found floating at the Horseferry in the morning. The attention of the
  authorities was drawn to the circumstance, and the magistrates being of
  opinion that a murder had been committed, caused the head to be washed
  and the hair combed out, and then had it placed on a pole and exposed to
  public view in St. Margaret's churchyard, in the hope that it might lead
  to the discovery of the suspected crime. Great crowds of persons of all
  ranks flocked to St. Margaret's churchyard to see the head, and amongst
  the rest a young man named Bennett, who perceiving the likeness to Hayes,
  whom he knew, immediately went to Mrs. Hayes on the subject; but she
  assured him that her husband was alive and well, which satisfied him. A
  journeyman tailor, named Patrick, also went to see the head, and on his
  return told his fellow workmen that it was Hayes. These workmen, who also
  had known Hayes, then went to look at the head, and felt the same
  conviction. It happened that Billings worked at the same shop in which
  these men were employed in Monmouth Street, and when he came to work next
  morning, they told him of the circumstance. Billings, however, lulled
  their suspicious by declaring that he had left Mr. Hayes at home that
  morning. After the head had been exhibited for four days in the
  churchyard, the magistrates caused it to be placed in spirits, in a glass
  vessel, and in that state it continued to be exposed to public view. Two
  friends of Hayes, named Ashley and Longmore, who had seen the head
  without imagining that it was his, some time after called on Mrs. Hayes,
  on separate occasions, to inquire for her husband, whose absence began to
  be noticed. Ashley and Longmore were mutual <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>friends, and their
  suspicions being excited by the contradictory statements which Mrs. Hayes
  had given to them, they went to look again at the head, when a minute
  examination satisfied them that it had belonged to Hayes. The
  apprehension of the murderers was the result. On the day they were
  brought up for examination, the trunk and limbs of the murdered man were
  found. Wood and Billings confessed and pleaded guilty. Katherine Hayes
  put herself on her country, was tried and convicted. Wood died in prison.
  Billings was hanged in Marylebone fields, near the pond in which Hayes's
  body had been concealed. Katherine Hayes was executed at Tyburn, under
  circumstances of great horror; for, in consequence of the fire reaching
  the executioner's hands, he left his hold of the rope with which he ought
  to have strangled the criminal, before he had executed that part of his
  duty, and the result was, that Katherine Hayes was burnt alive. The
  wretched woman was seen, in the midst of flames, pushing the blazing
  faggots from her, whilst she yelled in agony. Fresh faggots were piled
  around her, but a considerable time elapsed before her torments ended.
  She suffered on the 3rd of November, 1726. This tragedy forms the subject
  of a comic ballad which is attributed to Swift.</p>

  <p>The communication of E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W. (Vol. ii., p. 6.), which is as
  interesting as it is shocking, induces me to send you a short extract
  from <i>Harrison's Derby and Nottingham Journal, or Midland
  Advertiser</i>. The number of this journal which is dated Thursday,
  September 23, 1779, contains as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On Saturday two prisoners were capitally convicted at the Old Bailey
  of high treason, viz. Isabella Condon, for coining shillings in
  Cold-Bath-Fields; and John Field, for coining shillings in Nag's Head
  Yard, Bishopsgate Street. They will receive sentence to be drawn on a
  hurdle to the place of execution; <i>the woman to be burnt</i>, and the
  man to be hanged."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I presume that the sentence which the woman underwent was not
  executed. The barbarous fulfilment of such a law was, it may be hoped,
  already obsolete. The motives, however, upon which this law was grounded
  is worth noting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In treason of every kind," says Blackstone, "the punishment of women
  is the same, and different from that of men. For, <i>as the decency due
  to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies</i>,
  their sentence (which is to the full as terrible to sensation as the
  other) is to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive."
  "But," says the foot-note, "by the statute 30 Geo. III. c. 48., women
  convicted in all cases of treason, shall receive judgment to be drawn to
  the place of execution, and there to be hanged by the neck till
  dead."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The law, therefore, under which a woman could be put to death by
  burning, was repealed in 1790.</p>

  <p>Blackstone elsewhere says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The humanity of the English nation has authorized, by a tacit
  consent, an almost general mitigation of such part of those judgments as
  savours of torture and cruelty: a sledge or hurdle being usually allowed
  to such traitors as are condemned to be drawn; and there being very few
  instances (and those accidental or by negligence) of any persons being
  embowelled or burned, till previously deprived of sensation by
  strangling."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This corroborates the conclusion of E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;W., that the woman he
  describes was strangled at the stake to which her neck was bound.</p>

  <p>I wish to suggest to any of your legal or other well-informed
  correspondents, who will have the kindness to take a little trouble for
  the benefit of your general readers, that an instructive and interesting
  communication might be made by noting down the periods at which the
  various more revolting punishments under the English law were repealed,
  or fell into disuse. For instance, when torture, such as the rack, was
  last applied; when embowelling alive and quartering ceased to be
  practised; and whose was the last head that fell under the axe's bloody
  stroke. A word also on the use of the pillory, ducking-stool, stocks,
  &amp;c. would interest. Any illustrations of the modification of our
  penal code would throw valuable light on the philosophy and improvement
  of the national character. And I believe it would appear that the
  Reformation gradually swept away the black horrors of the torture-room;
  that the butchery of the headsman's block ceased at the close of the
  civil contest which settled the line of regal succession; and that
  hanging, which is the proper death of the cur, is now reserved for those
  only who place themselves out of the pale of humanity by striking at
  human life.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Death-bed Mystery.</i>&mdash;In conversation with an aged
  widow,&mdash;as devout and sensible as she is unlettered,&mdash;I
  yesterday learned a death-bed mystery which appeared new to me, and which
  (if not more commonly known than I take it to be) you may perhaps think
  worthy of a place in "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," to
  serve as a minor satellite to some more luminous communication, in reply
  to B.&nbsp;H. at Vol. i., p. 315. My informant's "<i>religio</i>" (as she
  appears to have derived it by tradition from her mother, and as confirmed
  by her own experience in the case of a father, a <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>husband, several
  children, and others), is to the effect that a considerable interval
  <i>invariably</i> elapses between the first semblance of death, and what
  she considers to be the departure of the soul.</p>

  <p>About five minutes after the time when death, to all outward
  appearance, has taken place, "the last breath," as she describes, may be
  seen to issue with a vapour, or "steam," out of the mouth of the
  departed.</p>

  <p>The statement reminds me of Webster's argument, in his <i>Display of
  supposed Witchcraft</i>, chap. xvi., where, writing of the bleeding of
  corpses in presence of their murderers, he observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If we physically consider the union of the soul with the body by the
  mediation of the spirit, then we cannot rationally conceive that the soul
  doth utterly forsake that union, until by putrefaction, tending to an
  absolute mutation, it is forced to bid farewell to its beloved
  tabernacle; for its not operating <i>ad extra</i> to our senses, doth not
  necessarily infer its total absence. And it may be, that there is more in
  that of <i>Abel's blood crying unto the Lord from the ground</i>, in a
  physical sense than is commonly conceived," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir Kenelm Digby (I think I remember) has also made some curious
  remarks on this subject, in his observations on the <i>Religio Medici</i>
  of Sir T. Brown.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Sansom.</span></p>

  <p><i>Easter Eggs.</i>-The custom of dyeing eggs at Easter (alluded to,
  Vol. i., pp. 244. and 397.) prevails in different parts of Cumberland,
  and is observed in this city probably more specially than in any other
  part of England. On Easter Monday and Tuesday the inhabitants assemble in
  certain adjacent meadows, the children all provided with stores of
  hard-boiled eggs, coloured or ornamented in various ways,&mdash;some
  being dyed an even colour with logwood, cochineal, &amp;c.; others
  stained (often in a rather elegant manner) by being boiled in shreds of
  parti-coloured ribbons; and others, again, covered with gilding. These
  they tumble about upon the grass until they break, when they finish off
  by eating them. These they call <i>pace</i>-eggs, being no doubt a
  corruption for <i>pasche</i>.</p>

  <p>This custom is mentioned by Brande as existing among the modern
  Greeks; but I believe it will be found more or less in almost all parts
  of Christendom.</p>

  <p>I observed when in Syria during Easter quantities of eggs similarly
  dyed; but it did not occur to me at the time to inquire whether the
  practice was connected with the season, and whether it was not confined
  to the native Christians.</p>

  <p>Information upon this point, and also upon the general origin of this
  ancient custom, would be interesting.</p>

  <p>Carlisle, June 3. 1850.</p>

  <p><i>May Marriages</i> (Vol. i., p. 467.).&mdash;This superstition is
  one of those which have descended to Christianity from Pagan observances,
  and which the people have adopted without knowing the cause, or being
  able to assign a reason. Carmelli tells us that it still prevailed in
  Italy in 1750.<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
  It was evidently of long standing in Ovid's time as it had passed then
  into a proverb among the people; nearly two centuries afterwards Plutarch
  (<i>Quæst. Rom.</i> 86.) puts the question: <span title="Dia ti toi Maiou mênos ouk agontai gunaikas" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&iota;&#x1F70; &tau;&#x1F77; &tau;&omicron;&#x1FD6;
  &Mu;&alpha;&#x1F77;&omicron;&upsilon; &mu;&eta;&nu;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;
  &omicron;&#x1F50;&kappa; &#x1F04;&gamma;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
  &gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&kappa;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>, which
  he makes a vain endeavour to answer satisfactorily. He assigns three
  reasons: <i>first</i>, because May being between April and June, and
  April being consecrated to Venus, and June to Juno, those deities held
  propitious to marriage were not to be slighted. The Greeks were not less
  observant of fitting seasons and the propitiation of the <span
  title="gamêlioi theoi" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&alpha;&mu;&#x1F74;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&iota; <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;'"
  >&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#x1F76;</span></span>. <i>Secondly</i>, on
  account of the great expiatory celebration of the <i>Lemuria</i>, when
  women abstained from the bath and the careful cosmetic decoration of
  their persons so necessary as a prelude to marriage rites.
  <i>Thirdly</i>, as some say, because May was the month of old men,
  <i>Majus a Majoribus</i>, and therefore June, being thought to be the
  month of the young, <i>Junius a Junioribus</i>, was to be preferred. The
  Romans, however, held other seasons and days unpropitious to matrimony,
  as the days in February when the Parentalia were celebrated, &amp;c.
  <i>June</i> was the favourite month; but no marriage was celebrated
  without an augury being first consulted and its auspices proved
  favourable (<i>Val. Max.</i> lib. ii. c. 1.). It would be well if some
  such superstitions observance among us could serve as a check to
  ill-advised and ill-timed marriages; and I would certainly advise all
  prudent females to continue to think that</p>

  <p><i>"Trash" or "Skriker."</i>&mdash;Many hundreds of persons there are
  in these districts who place implicit credence in the reality of the
  appearance of a death sign, locally termed <i>trash</i> or
  <i>skriker</i>. It has the appearance of a large black dog, with long
  shaggy hair, and, as the natives express it, "eyes as big as saucers."
  The first name is given to it form the peculiar noise made by its feet
  when passing along, resembling that of a heavy shoe in a miry road. The
  second appellation is in allusion to the sound of its voice when
  <i>heard</i> by those parties who are unable to <i>see</i> the appearance
  itself. According to the statements of parties who have seen the
  <i>trash</i> frequently, it makes its appearance to some member of that
  family from which death will shortly select his victim; and, at other
  times, to some very intimate acquaintance. Should any one be so
  courageous as to follow the appearance, it usually makes its retreat with
  its eyes <i>fronting</i> <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>the pursuer, and either sinks into the earth
  with a <i>strange noise</i>, or is lost upon the slightest momentary
  inattention. Many have attempted to strike it with any weapon they had at
  hand; but although the appearance stood its ground, no <i>material</i>
  substance could ever be detected. It may be added that "trash" does not
  confine itself to churchyards, though frequently seen in such
  localities.</p>

<h3>COLVIL'S WHIGG'S SUPPLICATION.</h3>

  <p>Heber possessed a curious MS. volume entitled <i>A Poetical
  Miscellany, selected from the Works of the Men of Genius of the XVIIth
  Century</i>. In Part XI. of the <i>Bibliotheca Heberiana</i> it is thus
  described:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The first part of this volume was obviously collected by a Scotchman,
  and it includes pieces by Ben Jonson, Wither, Dr. Donne, &amp;c. It must
  have been made in the latter part of the reign of Charles I. The second
  portion of the volume is a later production; a humourous poem, called a
  <i>Whig's Supplication</i>, by <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span>S. C., in which there is a remarkable notice
  of Cleveland, Donne, and 'Bass Divine.' The latter name somebody has
  ignorantly altered, not knowing, probably, who 'Bass Divine' was. The
  poem is in imitation of Hudibras, both in style and metre."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is somewhat singular that the writer of this notice never suspected
  that the <i>author</i> of the second part, and the <i>collector</i> of
  the first part of the volume, was Samuel Colvil, whose celebrated poem,
  <i>The Whigg's Supplication, or the Scotch Hudibras</i>, went through so
  many editions, from 1667 to 1796. This "mock poem", as the author terms
  it, turns upon the insurrection of the Covenanters in Scotland in the
  reign of Charles the Second. An interesting notice of it, and other
  imitations of Hudibras, will be found in the <i>Retrospective Review</i>,
  vol. iii. pp. 317-335.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>HUBERT LE S&OElig;UR'S SIX BRASS STATUES.</h3>

  <p>In a curious MS. Diary of the early part of the seventeenth century,
  lately come into my possession, I find the following entry concerning the
  sculptor, Hubert le S&oelig;ur:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"March 7. 1628. Had an interview with y<sup>e</sup> famous and justly
  renowned artiste H. le Sueur, who, being late come to this countrie, I
  had never seene before. He showed me several famous statues in
  brasse."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is probably the earliest notice of the celebrated pupil of John
  of Bologna after his settlement in England. Dallaway, in his <i>Anecdotes
  of the Arts in England</i> (p. 395.), after stating that Hubert le
  S&oelig;ur arrived here about the year 1630, says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If he was associated with Pierre Tacca, who finished the horse in the
  equestrian statue of Henry IV. in 1610, left incomplete on the death of
  his master, John of Bologna, two years preceding, he must have been far
  advanced in life. Three only of his works in bronze are now known with
  certainty to exist: the equestrian statue of Charles I. [at Charing
  Cross], a bust of the same monarch with a casque in the Roman style [now
  at Stourhead], and a statue in armour of William Herbert, Earl of
  Pembroke, Lord High Chamberlain and Chancellor of Oxford. The last was
  given to the University by T., Earl of Pembroke, about the time of the
  restoration."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The "several famous statues in brasse" alluded to by the writer of the
  Diary above quoted, were probably those which afterwards ornamented the
  gardens of St. James's Palace. Peacham, in his <i>Complete Gentleman</i>
  (2nd edit., 4to. 1634), having spoken of the collection of statues at
  Arundell House, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"King Charles also, ever since his coming to the Crown, hath amply
  testified a royal liking of ancient Statues, by causing a whole army of
  foreign Emperors, Captains, and Senators, all at once to land on his
  coasts, to come and do him homage and attend him in his Palaces of Saint
  James and Somerset House. A great part of these belonged to the great
  Duke of Mantua; and some of the old Greek marble bases, columns, and
  altars were brought from the ruins of Apollo's temple at Delos, by that
  noble and absolutely complete gentleman, Sir Kenelm Digby,
  Kn<sup>t</sup>. In the garden of St. James, there are also <i>half a
  dozen brass statues</i>, rare ones, cast by Hubert le Sueur, his
  Majesty's servant, now dwelling in St. Bartholomew's, London; the most
  industrious and excellent statuary, in all materials, that ever this
  country enjoyed. The best of them is the Gladiator, moulded from that in
  Cardinal Borghesi's Villa, by the procurement and industry of ingenious
  Master Gage. And at this present, the said Master Sueur hath divers other
  admirable moulds to cast in brass for his Majesty, and among the rest,
  that famous Diana of Ephesus. But the great Horse with his Majesty upon
  it, twice as great as the life, and now well nigh finished, will compare
  with that of the New Bridge at Paris, or those others at Florence and
  Madrid, though made by Sueur, his master John de Bologna, that rare
  workman, who not long since lived at Florence."</p>

  <p>The bronze statue of the Gladiator originally stood (according to Ned
  Ward's <i>London Spy</i>) in the Parade facing the Horse Guards. Dodsley
  (<i>Environs</i>, iii. 741.) says it was removed by Queen Anne to Hampton
  Court, and from thence, by George the Fourth, to the private grounds of
  Windsor Castle, where it now is. Query, What has become of the other five

<h3>BISHOP JEWELL'S LIBRARY.</h3>

  <p>What became of Bishop Jewell's library? Cassan mentions (<i>Lives of
  Bishops of Salisbury</i>, vol. ii. p. 55.) that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He had collected an excellent library of books of all sorts, not
  excepting the most impertinent of the Popish authors, and here it was
  that he spent the greatest and the best part of his time," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Bishop Jewell died Sept. 22. 1571.</p>

  <p>In the Account Books of Magdalen College, Oxford, I find the following
  items:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="scac">A. D.</span> 1572. Solut. D<sup>no</sup> Præsidi

  <p>Whether these books were a portion only, or the whole of the library
  of Bishop Jewell, I am unable to discover; nor am I aware at present
  whether Bishop Jewell's autograph is in any of the books of Magdalen
  College Library. The president was Lawrence Humphrey, author of a Life of

<h3>THE LOW WINDOW.</h3>

  <p>The low windows in the chancel of so many of our ancient churches have
  proved a fruitful source of discussion among archæologists, and numerous
  theories have been advanced respecting their use. Perhaps the words of
  the chameleon in the fable might be addressed to many who have attempted
  to account for their existence, "You all are right and all are
  wrong"&mdash;right in your supposition that they were thus used; but
  wrong in maintaining that this was the exclusive purpose. Some example,
  in fact, may be adduced irreconcileable with any particular conjecture,
  and sufficient to overturn every theory which may be set up. One object
  assigned is, the distribution of alms; and it is surely reasonable to
  imagine that money collected at the offertory should have been given to
  paupers from the chancel through this convenient aperture. The following
  passage from the <i>Ecclesiologist</i>, quoted in page 441. of "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," has induced me to bring this
  subject forward:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In them (churchyards) prayers are not now commonly poured forth to
  God, nor are doles distributed to his poor."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now it must be admitted that relief could scarcely be given to a crowd
  of importunate claimants without the interposition of some barrier; and
  where could a more appropriate place be found than the low window? Can
  any of your readers, therefore, oblige me with some information upon
  these points? Where were the alms bestowed, if not here? An almonry is
  described in some recent works as "a building near the church." What
  authority is there for such an assertion, and do any examples of such
  structures remain? What evidence is there that this business was
  transacted in the churchyard, in the porch, or in any particular part of
  the edifice?</p>

  <p>Although these mysterious openings are probably, with one or two
  exceptions in Normandy, peculiar to this country, it is desirable to
  ascertain where the poor on the Continent usually receive such charitable
  donations. In an interior of a Flemish cathedral, by an artist of the
  sixteenth century, a man is represented in the act of delivering bread to
  a number of eager beggars, from a sort of pew; showing, at least, as
  above remarked, that some such protection was requisite.</p>

  <p>There is another Query connected with this subject, which I beg to
  submit. Some ancient frescoes were lately discovered in the chapel of
  Eton College, with a compartment containing (according to a letter in the
  <i>Ecclesiologist</i>) a bishop administering the Holy Communion to a
  converted Jew, through a low window. Can any one, from recollection or
  the inspection of drawings, (for the original has disappeared,) assure me
  that he does not hold in his hand a piece of money, or a portion of
  bread, for the supply of his bodily wants?</p>

  <p><i>North Sides of Churchyards unconsecrated.</i>&mdash;In the West of
  England I have found an opinion to prevail in rural parishes, that the
  north side of our churchyards was left unconsecrated very commonly, in
  order that the youth of the village might have the use of it as a
  playground. And, in one parish, some few years ago, I had occasion to
  interrupt the game of football in a churchyard on the "revel" Sunday, and
  again on another festival. I also found some reluctance in the people to
  have their friends buried north of the church.</p>

  <p><i>Hatfield&mdash;Consecration of Chapel there.</i>&mdash;Le Neve, in

  the chapel in the house there lately built by Robert, Earl of Salisbury.
  I have applied to the Registrar of Lincoln diocese, in which Hatfield was
  (until recently) locally situated, for a copy of the notarial act of
  consecration; but it appears that the register of Bishop Neile was taken
  away or destroyed in the Great Rebellion, and that, consequently, no
  record of his episcopality now exists at Lincoln.</p>

  <p>Le Neve says he had the most part of his account of Bishop Neile from
  Thomas Baker, B.D. of St. John's College, Cambridge, who had it from a
  grandson of the Bishop's. He quotes also Featley's MS. Collections.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers inform me whether Bishop Neile's episcopal
  register for Lincoln is in existence, or whether any transcript of it is
  known? or if any evidence, confirmatory of Le Neve's statement of the
  fact and date of the consecration of the chapel of Hatfield, is known to
  exist?</p>

  but unfortunately I have not been an observer of your motto, and know not
  now where to refer for such instances. I shall therefore feel obliged to
  any of your readers who will specify a few instances of the profanation
  of churchyards at different periods, or refer me to works where such may
  be found. Churchyards appear to have been used in special cases for
  sepulture from the year 750, but not commonly so used till the end of the
  fourteenth century. Are there any instances of sepulchral monuments,
  between the above dates, now existing in churchyards?</p>

  <p>Stone crosses, evidently of Saxon or very early Roman structure, are
  found in churchyards, but I am not aware of any sepulchral monuments
  detached from the church of the same date. I shall be glad of any notices
  of early monuments or remarkable epitaphs in churchyards. When did
  churchyards cease to be places of sanctuary? What is the exact meaning of
  the word "yard?" and was not "God's acre" applied to Christian cemeteries
  before sepulture was admitted in churches or <span class="correction"

<h3>ON THE ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE STUDY OF
GEOMETRY IN LANCASHIRE.</h3>

  <p>The extensive study of geometry in Lancashire and the northern
  counties generally is a fact which has forced itself upon the attention
  of several observers; but none of these have attempted to assign any
  reasons for so singular an occurrence. Indeed, the origin and progress of
  the study of any particular branch of science, notwithstanding their
  attractive features, have but rarely engaged the attention of those best
  qualified for the undertaking. Fully satisfied with pursuing their
  ordinary courses of investigation, they have scarcely ever stopped to
  inquire <i>who</i> first started the subject of their contemplations; nor
  have they evinced much more assiduity to ascertain the <i>how</i>, the
  <i>when</i>, or in <i>what</i> favoured locality he had his existence:
  and hence the innumerable misappropriations of particular discoveries,
  the unconscious traversing of already exhausted fields of research, and
  many of the bickerings which have taken place amongst the rival claimants
  for the honour of priority.</p>

  <p>Mr. Halliwell's <i>Letters on the Progress of Science</i> sufficiently
  show that the study of geometry was almost a nonentity in England
  previously to the commencement of the eighteenth century. Before this
  period Dr. Dee, the celebrated author of the preliminary discourse to
  Billingsley's <i>Euclid</i>, had indeed resided at Manchester (1595), but
  his residence here could effect little in flavour of geometry, seeing, as
  is observed by a writer in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The character of the lectures on Euclid was in those days extremely
  different from that of our own time ... the propositions of Euclid being
  then taken as so many pegs to hang a speech upon."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Similar remarks evidently apply to Horrocks and Crabtree (1641); for
  although <i>both</i> were natives of Lancashire, and the latter a
  resident in the vicinity of Manchester, their early death would prevent
  the exertion of any considerable influence; nor does it appear that they
  ever paid any attention to the study of the ancient geometry. Richard
  Towneley, Esq., of Towneley (1671), is known to have been an ardent
  cultivator of science, but his residence was principally in London. It
  may, however, be mentioned to his honour, <i>that he was the first to
  discover what is usually known as "Marriotte's Law"</i> for the expansion
  of gases. At a later period (1728-1763), the name of "John Hampson, of
  Leigh, in Lancashire," appears as a correspondent to the <i>Lady's
  Diary</i>; but since he mostly confined his speculations to subjects
  relating to the Diophantine Analysis, he cannot be considered as the
  originator of the revival in that branch of study now under
  consideration. Such being the case, we are led to conclude that the
  "Oldham Mathematical Society" was really the great promoter of the study
  of the ancient geometry in Lancashire; for during the latter half of the
  last century, and almost up to the present date, it has numbered amongst
  its members several of the most distinguished geometers of modern times.
  A cursory glance at some of the mathematical periodicals of that date
  will readily furnish the names of Ainsworth, whose elegant productions in
  pure geometry adorn the pages of the <i>Gentleman's</i> and <i>Burrow's
  Diaries</i>; Taylor, the distinguished tutor of Wolfenden; Fletcher,
  whose investigations in the <i>Gentleman's Diary</i> and the
  <i>Mathematical Companion</i> entitle him to the highest praise;
  Wolfenden, acknowledged by all as one of the most profound mathematicians
  of the last century; Hilton, afterwards the talented editor of that "work
  of rare merit" the <i>Liverpool Student</i>; and last, though not least,
  the distinguished Butterworth, whose elegant and extensive correspondence
  occupies so conspicuous a place in the <i>Student</i>, the
  <i>Mathematical Repository</i>, the <i>Companion</i>, the
  <i>Enquirer</i>, the <i>Leeds Correspondent</i>, and the <i>York
  Courant</i>. Besides these, we find the names of Mabbot, Wood, Holt
  (Mancuniensis), Clarke (Salfordoniiensis), as then resident at Manchester
  and in constant communication with, if not actually members of the
  society; nor can it be doubted from the evidence of existing documents
  that the predilection for the study of the ancient geometry evinced by
  various members of this Lancashire School, exercised considerable
  influence upon the minds of such distinguished proficients as Cunliffe,
  Campbell, Lowry, Whitley, and Swale.</p>

  <p>Hence it would seem that <i>many</i>, and by no means improbable,
  reasons may be assigned for "the very remarkable circumstance of the
  geometrical analysis of the ancients having been cultivated with eminent
  success in the northern counties of England, and particularly in
  Lancashire." Mr. Harvey, at the York meeting of the British Association
  in 1831, eloquently announced "that when Playfair, in one of his
  admirable papers in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, expressed a fear that
  the increasing taste for analytical science would at length drive the
  <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span>ancient geometry from its favoured retreat
  in the British Isles; the Professor seemed not to be aware that there
  existed a devoted band of men in the north, resolutely bound to the pure
  and ancient forms of geometry, who in the midst of the tumult of steam
  engines, cultivated it with unyielding ardour, preserving the sacred fire
  under circumstances which would seem from their nature most calculated to
  extinguish it." Mr. Harvey, however, admitted his inability clearly to
  trace the "true cause of this remarkable phenomenon," but at the same
  time suggested that "a taste for pure geometry, something like that for
  entomology among the weavers of Spitalfields, may have been transmitted
  from father to son; but who was the distinguished individual <i>first</i>
  to create it, in the peculiar race of men here adverted to, seems not to
  be known." However, as "the two great restorers of ancient geometry,
  Matthew Stewart and Robert Simson, it may be observed, lived in
  Scotland," he asks the important questions:&mdash;"Did their proximity
  encourage the growth of this spirit? Or were their writings cultivated by
  some teacher of a village school, who communicated by a method, which
  genius of a transcendental order knows so well how to employ, a taste for
  these sublime inquiries, so that at length they gradually worked their
  way to the anvil and the loom?"</p>

  <p>An attentive consideration of these questions in all their bearings
  has produced in the mind of the writer a full conviction that we must
  look to other sources for the revival of the study of the ancient
  geometry than either the writings of Stewart or Simson. It has been well
  observed by the most eminent geometer of our own times, Professor
  Davies&mdash;whose signature of <span class="sc">Pen-and-Ink</span> (Vol.
  ii., p. 8.) affords but a flimsy disguise for his well-known <i>propria
  persona</i>&mdash;that "it was a great mistake for these authors to have
  written their principal works in the Latin language, as it has done more
  than anything else to prevent their study among the only geometers of the
  eighteenth century who were competent to understand and value them;" and
  it is no less singular than true, as the same writer elsewhere observes,
  "that whilst Dr. Stewart's writings were of a kind calculated to render
  them peculiarly attractive to the non-academic school of English
  geometers, they remain to this day less generally known than the writings
  of any geometer of these kingdoms." The same remarks, in a slightly
  qualified form, may be applied to most of the writings of Simson; for
  although his edition of Euclid is now the almost universally adopted
  text-book of geometry in England, at the time of its first appearance in
  1756 it did not differ so much from existing translations as to attract
  particular attention by the novelty of its contents. Moreover, at this
  time the impulse had already been given and was silently exerting its
  influence upon a class of students of whose existence Dr. Simson appears
  to have been completely ignorant. In one of his letters to Nourse
  (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, Sept. 1848, p. 204.) he regrets that "the taste for
  the ancient geometry, or indeed any geometry, seems to be quite worn
  out;" but had he instituted an examination of those contemporary
  periodicals either wholly or partially devoted to mathematics, he would
  have been furnished with ample reasons for entertaining a different
  opinion.</p>

  <p>We have every reason to believe that the publication of Newton's
  <i>Principia</i> had a powerful effect in diffusing a semi-geometrical
  taste amongst the academical class of students in this country, and it is
  equally certain that this diffusion became much more general, when Motte,
  in 1729, published his translation of that admirable work. The nature of
  the contents of the <i>Principia</i>, however, precluded the possibility
  of its being adapted to form the taste of novices in the study of
  geometry; it served rather to exhibit the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of the
  science, and produced its effect by inducing the student to master the
  rudimentary treatises thoroughly, in order to qualify himself for
  understanding its demonstrations, rather than by providing a series of
  models for his imitation. A powerful inducement to the study of pure
  geometry was therefore created by the publication of Motte's translation:
  ordinary students had here a desirable object to obtain by its careful
  cultivation, which hitherto had not existed, and hence when Professor
  Simpson, of Woolwich, published his <i>Algebra</i> and the <i>Elements of
  Geometry</i> in 1745 and 1747, a select reading public had been formed
  which hailed these excellent works as valuable accessions to the then
  scanty means of study. Nor must the labours of Simpson's talented
  associates, Rollinson and Turner, be forgotten when sketching the
  progress of this revival. The pages of the <i>Ladies' Diary</i>, the
  <i>Mathematician</i>, and the <i>Mathematical Exercises</i>, of which
  these gentlemen were severally editors and contributors, soon began to
  exhibit a goodly array of geometrical exercises, whilst their lists of
  correspondents evince a gradual increase in numbers and ability. The
  publication of Stewart's <i>General Theorems</i> and Simson's edition of
  <i>Euclid</i>, in 1746 and 1756, probably to some extent assisted the
  movement; but the most active elements at work were undoubtedly the
  mathematical periodicals of the time, aided by such powerful auxiliaries
  as Simpson's <i>Select Exercises</i> (1752) and his other treatises
  previously mentioned. It may further be observed that up to this period
  the mere English reader had few, if any means of obtaining access to the
  elegant remains of the ancient geometers. Dr. Halley had indeed given his
  restoration of Apollonius's <i>De Sectione Rationis</i> and <i>Sectione
  Spatii</i> in 1706. Dr. Simson had also issued his edition of the
  <i>Locis Planis</i> in 1749; but unfortunately the very language in which
  these valuable works were written, precluded the possibility of <!-- Page
  59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>these
  unlettered students being able to derive any material advantages from
  their publication: and hence arises another weighty reason why Simpson's
  writings were so eagerly studied, seeing they contained the leading
  propositions of some of the most interesting researches of the
  Alexandrian School.</p>

  <p>After the death of Simpson, the Rev. John Lawson, who appears to have
  inherited no small portion of the spirit of his predecessors, began to
  take the lead in geometrical speculations; and having himself carefully
  studied the principal writings of the ancient geometers, now formed the
  happy project of unfolding these treasures of antiquity to the general
  reader, by presenting him with English translations of most of these
  valuable remains. With this view he published a translation of Vieta's
  restoration of <i>Apollonius on Tangencies</i>, in 1764, and to this, in
  the second edition of 1771, was added the <i>Treatise on Spherical
  Tangencies</i>, by Fermat, which has since been reprinted in the
  <i>Appendix to the Ladies' Diary</i> for 1840. In 1767 appeared Emerson's
  <i>Treatise on Conic Sections</i>; a work which, notwithstanding its
  manifest defects, contributed not a little to aid the student in his
  approaches to the higher geometry, but whose publication would probably
  have been rendered unnecessary, had Dr. Simson so far loosened himself
  from the trammels of the age, as to have written his own admirable
  treatise in the English language. The frequency, however, with which Mr.
  Emerson's treatise has been quoted, almost up to the present date, would
  appear to justify the propriety of including <i>it</i> amongst the means
  by which the study of geometry was promoted during the last generation.
  The success which attended Mr. Lawson's first experiment induced him to
  proceed in his career of usefulness by the publication, in 1772, of the
  <i>Treatise on Determinate Section</i>; to which was appended an amended
  restoration of the same work by Mr. William Wales, the well-known
  geometer, who attended Captain Cook as astronomer, in one of his earlier
  voyages. In 1773 appeared the <i>Synopsis of Data for the Construction of
  Triangles</i>, which was followed in 1774 by his valuable
  <i>Dissertations on the Geometrical Analysis of the Ancients</i>; and
  although the author used an unjustifiable freedom with the writings of
  others, Dr. Stewart's more especially, it is nevertheless a work which
  probably did more to advance the study of the ancient geometry than any
  other separate treatise which could be named. As these publications
  became distributed amongst mathematicians, the <i>Magazines</i>, the
  <i>Diaries</i>, and various other periodicals, began to show the results
  of the activity which had thus been created; geometrical questions became
  much more abundant, and a numerous list of contributions appeared which
  afford ample proof that their able authors had entered deeply into the
  spirit of the ancient geometry. During the year 1777 Mr. Lawson issued
  the first portion of Dr. Simson's restoration of <i>Euclid's Porisms</i>,
  translated from the <i>Opera Reliqua</i> of that distinguished geometer;
  and though the work was not continued, sufficient had already been done
  to furnish the generality of students with a clue to the real nature of
  this celebrated enigma of antiquity. The last of these worthy benefactors
  to the non-academic geometers of the last century was Mr. Reuben Burrow,
  who by publishing in 1779 his <i>Restitution of Apollonius Pergæus on
  Inclinations</i> gave publicity to a valuable relic which would otherwise
  have remained buried in the Latin obscurity of Dr. Horsley's more
  elaborate production.</p>

  <p>During the greater portion of the time just reviewed, Mr. Jeremiah
  Ainsworth was resident in the neighbourhood of Manchester, and so early
  as 1761 was in correspondence with the editors of the <i>Mathematical
  Magazine</i>. He subsequently associated with Mr. George Taylor, a
  gentleman of kindred habits, then resident in the immediate vicinity, and
  these worthy veterans of science, as time wore on, collected around them
  a goodly array of pupils and admirers, and hence may truly be said not
  only to have laid the foundation of the "Oldham Society," but also to
  have been the fathers of the Lancashire school of geometers. Such then
  was the state of affairs in the mathematical world at the period of which
  we are speaking; all the works just enumerated were attracting the
  attention of all classes of students by their novelty or elegance; Dr.
  Hutton and the Rev. Charles Wildbore had the management of the
  <i>Diaries</i>, each vieing with the other in offering inducements for
  geometrical research; whilst both, in this respect, for a time, had to
  contend against the successful competition of Reuben Burrow, the talented
  editor of Carnan's <i>Diary</i>: correspondents consequently became
  numerous and widely extended, each collecting around him his own select
  circle of ardent inquirers; and thus it was, to use the words of Mr.
  Harvey, and answer the questions proposed, that inquiries which had
  hitherto been "locked up in the deep, and to them unapproachable recesses
  of Plato, Pappus, Apollonius and Euclid * * porisms and loci, sections of
  ratio and of space, inclinations and tangencies,&mdash;subjects confined
  among the ancients to the very greatest minds, (became) familiar to men
  whose condition in life was, to say the least, most unpropitious for the
  successful prosecution of such elevated and profound pursuits."</p>

  <p>The preceding sketch is respectfully submitted as an attempt to answer
  the queries of <span class="sc">Pen-and-Ink</span>, so far as Lancashire
  is concerned. It is not improbable that other reasons, equally cogent, or
  perhaps corrective of several of the preceding, may be advanced by some
  of your more learned correspondents, whose experience and means of
  reference are superior to my own. Should any such <!-- Page 60 --><span

  additions or corrections to what is here attempted, and to extend the
  inquiry into other localities, your pages will afford a most desirable

  understood but most important subject of inquiry.</p>

<h3>QUERIES ANSWERED, NO. 8.</h3>

  <p>Passing over various queries of early date, on which it has been my
  intention to offer some suggestions, I have <i>endeuoyred me</i>, as
  Master Caxton expresses it, to illustrate three subjects recently
  mooted.</p>

  <p><i>Trianon</i> (No. 27.).&mdash;The origin of this name is thus stated
  by M. Dolort, in his excellent work entitled <i>Mes voyages aux environs
  de Paris</i>, ii. 88.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Le grand Trianon.</i>&mdash;Appelé au 13<sup>e</sup> siècle
  <i>Triarmun</i>, nom d'une ancienne paroisse, qui était divisée en trois
  villages dépendant du diocèse de Chartres. Cette terre, qui appartenait
  aux moines de Sainte-Geneviève, fut achetée par Louis XIV. pour agrandir
  le parc de Versailles, et plus tard il y fit coustruire le château."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Wood paper</i> (No. 32.).&mdash;At the close of the last century a
  patent was granted to Matthias Koops for the manufacture of paper from
  <i>straw</i>, <i>wood</i>, &amp;c. In September 1800, he dedicated to the
  king a <i>Historical account of the substances which have been used to
  describe events</i>, in small folio. The volume is chiefly printed on
  paper <i>made from straw</i>; the appendix is on <i>paper made from wood
  alone</i>. Both descriptions of paper have borne the test of time
  extremely well. Murray, in his <i>Practical remarks on modern paper</i>,
  speaks of Koops and his inventions with much ignorance and
  unfairness.</p>

  <p><i>Tobacco in the East</i> (No. 33.).&mdash;Relying on the testimony
  of Juan Fragoso, physician to Felipe II. of Spain, I venture to assert
  that tobacco is not indigenous to the East. To the same effect writes
  Monardes. Nevertheless, it was cultivated in Java as early as the year
  1603. Edmund Scott, factor for the East India Company at Bantam, thus
  describes the luxuries of the Javans:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  loafe: and also a nutt called <i>pinange</i>, which are both in operation
  very hott, and they eate them continually to warme them within, and keepe
  them from the fluxe. They doe likewise take much <i>tabacco</i>, and also

<h3>MEANING OF "BAWN."</h3>

  <p><i>Bawn</i> (Vol. i, p. 440.) has been explained as "the outer
  fortification, inclosing the court-yard of an Irish castle or mansion,
  and was generally composed of a wall with palisadoes, and sometimes
  flankers."</p>

  <p>The word <i>bawn</i> or <i>bane</i> (the <i>a</i> pronounced as in the
  English word <i>hat</i>) is still applied in the south of Ireland to the
  spot of ground used as a place for milking the cows of a farm, which, for
  obvious reasons, is generally close to the farm-house. Before the
  practice of housing cattle became general, every country gentleman's
  house had its <i>bawn</i> or <i>bane</i>. The necessity for having such a
  place well fenced, and indeed fortified, in a country and period when
  cattle formed the chief wealth of all parties, and when the country was
  infested by Creaghadores and Rapparees, is obvious; and hence the care
  taken in compelling the "undertakers in Ulster" to have at least "a good
  bawn after the Irish fashion." In Munster the word <i>bane</i> or
  <i>bawn</i> is used to express land that has been long in grass;
  <i>tholluff bawn</i> being used to signify grass land about to be brought
  into cultivation; and <i>tholluff breagh</i>, or <i>red land</i>, land
  which has been recently turned. To <i>redden land</i> is still used to
  express either to plough land, or, more generally, to turn land with the
  spade.</p>

  <p>Now the <i>milking field</i> was, and is always kept in grass, and
  necessarily receiving a good deal of manure, would usually be
  <i>white</i> from the growth of daisies and white clover. Hence such a
  field would be called the <i>white</i> field: and from this to the
  general application of the phrase to grass land the transition is easy
  and natural. It may be proper to add, that in Kerry, particularly, the
  word is pronounced <i>bawn</i>, in speaking <i>Irish</i>; but the same
  person will call it <i>bane</i>, if mentioning such land in English. The
  <i>a</i> in the latter word is, as I said before, pronounced like the
  <i>a</i> in hat.</p>

  <p>The Irish for a <i>cow</i> being <i>bo</i>, the phrase may have had
  its origin therefrom. On this matter, as on all relating to Irish
  antiquities, the readers of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>"
  may be glad to have a sure person to refer to; and they cannot refer to a
  more accomplished Irish scholar and antiquarian than "Eugene Curry". His
  address is, "Royal Irish Academy, Grafton Street, Dublin."</p>

<h2>Replies To Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Births, Marriages, &amp;c., Taxes on</i> (Vol. ii., p.
  10.).&mdash;The first instance, that I am aware of, of a tax on marriages
  in this country, occurs in the 5 of Wm. and Mary, c. 21. The war in which
  William engaged soon rendered it necessary to tax other incidents of
  humanity; and accordingly the 6 &amp; 7 Wm. III. c. 6. was passed,
  granting to his Majesty certain <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>rates and duties upon marriages, births,
  deaths, and burials, and upon bachelors and widowers (a widely-spread
  net), for the term of five years, "for carrying on the war against France
  with vigour." The taxes on births, marriages, and burials were continued
  indefinitely by the 7 &amp; 8 Wm. III. c. 35. I know not when this act
  was repealed; but by the 23 George III. c. 67., taxes were again imposed
  on burials, births, marriages, and christenings; and by 25 George III. c.
  75. these taxes were extended to Dissenters. By the 34 George III. c.
  11., the taxes were repealed, and they ceased on October 1st, 1794. The
  entries in the parish register noticed by <span class="sc">Arun</span>,
  refer to these taxes. Query, Were our ancestors justified in boasting
  that they were "free-born" Englishmen as long as one of these taxes
  existed?</p>

  <p><i>M.</i> or <i>N.</i> (Vol. i., p. 415.).&mdash;These must, I think,
  be the initials of some words, and not originating in a corruption of
  nom, as suggested. We have in the marriage service:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"'I publish the banns of marriage between M. of &mdash;&mdash; and N. of &mdash;&mdash;.'</p>
      <p>"The curate shall say unto the man,</p>
      <p>"M. 'Wilt thou have this woman,' &amp;c.</p>
      <p>"The priest shall say unto the woman,</p>
      <p>"N. 'Wilt thou have this man,' &amp;c.</p>

      <p>Again, "Forasmuch as M. and N. have consented together," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>All these passages would go to show that the letters are initials

  <p><i>Arabic Numerals.</i>&mdash;I am not entitled to question either the
  learning or the "acumen" of the Bishop of Rochester; but I am entitled to
  question the <i>interpretation</i> which E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;T. tells us (Vol. ii.,
  p.27.) he puts upon the Castleacre inscription. My title to do so is
  this:&mdash;that in the year of grace 1084 the Arabic numerals were not
  only of necessity unknown to the "plaisterers" of those walls, but even
  (as far as evidence has been yet adduced) to the most learned of
  England's learned men.</p>

  <p>As to the regular order in crossing himself, that will entirely depend
  upon whether the plaister was considered to be a knight's shield, and the
  figures the blazonry, or not. Is it not, indeed, stated in one of your
  former numbers, that this very inscription was to be read 1408, and not
  1048? I have already hinted at the necessity of <i>caution</i> in such
  cases; and Mr. Wilkinson of Burnley has given, in a recent number of your
  work, two exemplifications. The Bishop of Rochester certainly adds
  another; though, of course, undesignedly.</p>

  <p><i>Comment. in Apocalypsin</i> (Vol. i., p. 452.).&mdash;There was a
  copy of this volume in the library of the Duke of Brunswick; and in the
  hope that Sir F. Madden may succeed in obtaining extracts, or a sight of
  it, I intimate just as much, though not in this kingdom. (See Von der
  Hardt's <i>Autographa Lutheri et Coætaneorum</i>, tom. iii. 171.) You do
  not seem to have any copy whatever brought to your notice. This
  collection was, it appears from the <i>Centifolium Lutheranum</i> of
  Fabricius (p. 484.), bequeathed by the Duke to the library at

  <p><i>Robert Deverell</i> (Vol. i., p. 469.).&mdash;If my information is
  too scanty to deserve a place among the Replies, you may treat it as a
  supplement to Dr. Rimbault's Query. Mr. Deverell also published
  (according to Lowndes) <i>A New View of the Classics and Ancient Arts,
  tending to show the invariable Connexion with the Sciences</i>, 4to.
  Lond. 1806; and <i>Discoveries in Hieroglyphics and other
  Antiquities</i>, 6 vols. 8vo. Lond. 1813,&mdash;which was suppressed by
  the author after a few copies had been sold. I have the second and third
  volumes, being all that relates to Shakspeare. They consist of an edition
  of Hamlet, Lear, Othello, Merchant of Venice, and the third satire of
  Horace, copiously illustrated with notes and woodcuts, intended to prove
  that in the works in question, in common with "all the classics and the
  different specimens of the arts which have come down to us from the
  ancients, no part of them is to be understood without supposing that they
  were mere vehicles of knowledge, not intended to meet the eye or the
  understanding on the first inspection or perusal;" in short, that all the
  phrases, characters, and incidents are merely allusions to the
  appearances of the moon! a representation of which, and of Shakspearian
  characters, &amp;c., bearing supposed resemblance to its lights and
  shadows, form the staple of the illustrations. I collect from passages in
  these volumes, that the first was devoted to a similar illustration of
  Hudibras. The whole affair seems to afford indications of insanity. In
  the <i>Biographical Dictionary of Living Authors</i>, 8vo., Lond. 1816, I
  find that in 1802 he was returned to Parliament by the borough of
  Saltash, in Cornwall: and from the same authority it also appears that,
  in addition to the works above noticed, he was the author of <i>A Guide
  to the Knowledge of the Ancients</i>, 1803, and <i>A letter to Mr.
  Whitbread on two Bills pending in Parliament</i>, 8vo. 1807.</p>

  <p><i>The Hippopotamus.</i>&mdash;<i>The Scotch Kilt.</i>&mdash;I was on
  the point of addressing a Minor Query to you, when No. 33. arrived, and
  therein I saw a Major Query from L. (p.36.), which prompts an immediate
  answer. He asks, "Has there been a live hippopotamus in Europe since the
  reign of Commodus?" To be sure there has, and Capitolinus would have set
  him right. A goodly assemblage of animals of all sorts was collected by
  Gordianus Pius, but used by the elder Philip, for the celebration of the
  secular games on the 1000th anniversary of the building of Rome, or A.D.
  248. Among them were 32 elephants, 10 tigers, 10 elks, 60 lions, 30
  leopards, 10 hyænas, 1 hippopotamus, 1 rhinoceros, 40 wild horses, 20
  wild asses, and 10 giraffes, with a vast quantity of deer, goats,
  antelopes, and other beasts. "And," it is added in Captain Smyth's Roman
  Catalogue, "still further to increase the public <i>hilarity</i>, 2000
  gladiators were matched in mortal affray."</p>

  <p>The portrait of the hippopotamus exhibited on that splendid occasion
  is well represented upon the large brass medals of Otacilia Severa,
  Philip's wife, and on those of their son, Philip Junior. That of Otacilia
  is described at length in Captain Smyth's work.</p>

  <p>Now for my Minor Query. Can you, Sir, or any of your intelligent
  correspondents, oblige me by saying who introduced the kilt into Scotland
  and when? However it may wound local prejudice, I fear our northern
  brethren will find its use to be much more recent than they seem willing
  to be aware of. At present I will not put a rider on the question, by
  asking, whether an Englishman first gave it them: but perhaps you, Sir,
  will sift it thoroughly, even although a whole corps of rabid MacNicolls
  should enter the field against you.</p>

  <p>It is plain that this has nothing to do with the treatment of the

  it is synonymous with dust. As to dust, this is perfectly plain in

  Cook, of Abeley, Essex, having seen this Query, which had been kindly
  quoted into <i>The Athenæum</i> of the 25th ultimo, communicated to that
  journal on Saturday, June 1st, the following information respecting two
  of these caves, the result of a personal examination of them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The shafts are five in number; and are situated at <!-- Page 63
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span>the edge of
  Hanging Wood, in the parish of Chadwell, about three miles from Grays
  Pier. I descended two of them in 1847, by means of a rope and pulley
  fixed to the branch of a neighbouring tree,&mdash;taking the precaution
  to have a lighted lanthorn swinging a few yards beneath me. They were
  between eighty and ninety feet in depth,&mdash;their diameter at the top
  six feet, gradually diminishing to three feet at the bottom. There was a
  great deal of drift sand at the bottom of the shaft, extending a
  considerable way up, which nearly blocked up the entrance to the
  chambers. By treading down the sand I soon gained an entrance, and found
  five chambers communicating with the shaft&mdash;three on one side and
  two on the other. In form they were nearly semicircular. Their dimensions
  were small, not exceeding thirty feet in length by fifteen in width, but

  <p><i>Mistake in Conybeare and Howson's Life of St. Paul.</i>&mdash;In
  the splendid and learned <i>Life of St. Paul</i>, now publishing by
  Messrs. Longmans, there occurs in a note a broad assertion, but quite
  erroneous, which may mislead those who would be inclined to take it
  without examination, induced by the general accuracy and learning of the
  work. At page 35, note 1., the writer says, "It is remarkable that the
  Sadducees are mentioned in no other books of the New Testament, except
  St. Matthew and the Acts." I mentioned this as a <i>fact</i> to a friend,
  who immediately remembered a passage in St. Luke, chap. xx. v. 27.: "Then
  came to him certain of the Sadducees," &amp;c. I then turned out
  Sadducees in Cruden, and there found only Matthew and Acts referred to.
  On looking at the passage of St. Mark parallel to the abovementioned of
  St. Luke, I read, "Then came unto him the Sadducees," &amp;c. (xii. 18.)
  The note, therefore, should end, "except the first three Gospels and the
  Acts."</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, CATALOGUES, SALES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The Rev. W. Haslam, the author of <i>Perran Zabuloe</i>, has just
  issued a little volume entitled <i>The Cross and the Serpent, being a
  brief History of the Triumph of the Cross through a long Series of Ages
  in Prophecy, Types, and Fulfilments</i>. Though the present work belongs
  to one of the two classes which, for obvious reasons, we do not undertake
  to notice in our columns, there is so much of curious matter illustrative
  of Folk Lore, early remains, and old-world customs, in the third part of
  it, as to justify our directing the attention of our antiquarian readers
  to the archæology of the volume. The Druidic Beltein or Midsummer Fire
  still burns brightly, it appears, in Cornwall. We shall endeavour to
  transfer to our Folk Lore columns some passages on this and other cognate
  subjects.</p>

  <p>Mr. Russell Smith announces a series of <i>Critical and Historical
  Tracts</i> on the subject of, I. <i>Agincourt</i>; II. <i>First Colonists
  of New England</i> (this is already issued); and III. Milton, a <i>Sheaf
  of Gleanings after his Biographers and Annotators</i>. The name of Joseph
  Hunter, F.S.A., which figures upon their title-pages, is a sufficient
  warrant that they will deserve the attention of the historical
  student.</p>

  <p>Mr. M. A. Denham, the author of the interesting <i>Collection of
  Proverbs and Popular Sayings relating to the Seasons, Weather,
  &amp;c.</i>, published by the Percy Society, also intends to issue some
  Tracts (limited to fifty copies of each) illustrative of the antiquities
  of the northern parts of the kingdom. The first is to be on <i>The
  Slogans or Slughorns of the North of England</i>; the second, on <i>"Some
  of the Manners and Customs"</i> of the North.</p>

  handsomely printed in 4to.; half-bound in morocco, 15<i>s</i>.</p>

  <p>This interesting MS., so frequently alluded to by Dr. Burney in the
  course of his "History of Music," has been kindly placed at the disposal
  of the Council of the Musical Antiquarian Society, by George Townshend
  Smith, Esq., Organist of Hereford Cathedral. But the Council, not feeling
  authorised to commence a series of literary publications, yet impressed
  with the value of the work, have suggested its independent publication to
  their Secretary, Dr. Rimbault, under whose editorial care it accordingly
  appears.</p>

  <p>It abounds with interesting Musical Anecdotes; the Greek Fables
  respecting the origin of Music; the rise and progress of Musical
  Instruments; the early Musical Drama; the origin of our present
  fashionable Concerts; the first performance of the Beggar's Opera,

  <p>THE CHORAL RESPONSES AND LITANIES OF THE UNITED CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND

  <p>The present Work contains a full collection of the harmonized
  compositions of ancient date, including nine sets of pieces and
  responses, and fifteen litanies, with a few of the more ancient Psalm
  Chants. They are given in full score, and in their proper cliffs. In the
  upper part, however, the treble is substituted for the "cantus" or
  "medius" cliff: and the whole work is so arranged as to suit the library
  of the musical student, and to be fit for use in the Choir.</p>

  <p>THE DEVOTIONAL LIBRARY. Edited by <span class="sc">Walter Farquhar

  <p>The Devotional Library was commenced in 1846. The design of the
  Proprietors was to publish, at the lowest possible price, a series of
  Works, original, or selected from well-known Church of England Divines,
  which, from their practical character, as well as their cheapness, would
  be peculiarly useful to the clergy for parochial distribution. Since that
  period the following have appeared:&mdash;</p>
